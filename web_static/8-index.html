                                                Converting between GPA and specific grading systems can be a bit tricky
						since it varies across institutions. 
                                                However, a CWA (Cumulative Weighted Average) of 70.00 generally corresponds 
						to a GPA around 2.0 on a 4.0 scale. 
                                                Keep in mind that this is a rough estimate, and the exact conversion 
                                                may depend on the grading scale used by your educational institution.
